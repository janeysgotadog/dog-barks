# dog-barks

This is to be my first attempt to write my own javascript, so I thought I would make it very simple. I think I need to def dog and cat. have the action make a loop looking for cat inside a set of boundaries. I could even take cat in and out according to a set schedule. Dog has to have a Boolean argument set True, then output "Bark". Otherwise False is Null, and the loop should start again. I may not have it thought out well enough yet, too. And I'm trying to GitBetter! when this is my first day here. Do I have to put in the notation to signify comments?
I want to create an event that looks to see if a cat is inside my parameters, and if true, dog has behavior Bark. Null = false.

so here i could write code and then delete the above crap
so I want to use javascript??
do I
hmm how is it going to be contained
output how?
